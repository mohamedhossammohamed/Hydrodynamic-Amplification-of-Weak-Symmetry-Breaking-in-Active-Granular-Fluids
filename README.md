# Hydrodynamic-Amplification-of-Weak-Symmetry-Breaking-in-Active-Granular-Fluids
Resolving the "directional selection puzzle," this study uses GPU simulations of 12,000 particles to identify hydrodynamic amplification. It demonstrates that at intermediate densities, fluid coupling amplifies weak biases by ~17x, triggering a sharp phase transition (\beta_c \approx 0.92) into locked vortex states.
